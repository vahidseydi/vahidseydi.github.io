            <h3 class="prj_title">the Smart Efficient Energy Centre (SEEC)</h3>
            <p class="prj_desc">SEEC is an interdisciplinary £7M “big data” research centre that is addressing priorities in low carbon energy science. SEEC is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, administered through the Welsh Government. SEEC is a flagship strategic development for the newly formed College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at Bangor University. It will lead innovation on how advanced engineering, computer science and modelling can be applied most effectively to tackle grand challenges of increasing the sustainability of energy supply and utilization, while minimizing negative environmental impacts, in particular net carbon emissions. SEEC will be instrumental in positioning Wales at the forefront of this technological revolution, which is one of the highest priorities to address within the current climate crisis.</p>

                A number of common challenges exist within SEEC. There is a need to make best use of the large datasets acquired through sensor and observing networks. Numerical models require large datasets, for example for initialization, calibration and verification. The outputs of models require analysis to improve knowledge and provide robust predictions. The developed cyberinfrastructure will exploit state-of-the-art IT capabilities to provide a shared facility for data management, including data storage, data discovery and download services, alongside advanced data analytics capabilities. Data and analytical tools will be cloud hosted and provide scalable and tailored solutions for SEEC participants, collaborators and other stakeholders. As a member of the  <a href="http://www.seacams.ac.uk/seacams2/imardis.php.en">iMarDIS</a> team, I work on this data infrastructure to bring together diverse ocean science datasets and make them available to various research and industrial partners within the offshore renewable energy and ocean sciences community. Visualising data so that it would be informative and well exploited in the fields of education, research, and industry, along with investigating the interaction of AI and machine learning with the collected marine data are two parts of the project's intentions <a href="https://portal.imardis.org/">iMardDIS-portal</a>, <a href="https://imardis-analyser-dev.imardis.org/">iMardDIS-Analyser</a> and <a href="https://observatory-dashboard-dev.imardis.org/">observatory-dashboard</a> are examples of visualizing data.

            <h3 class="prj_title">Ecological implications of accelerated seabed mobilityaround windfarms (EcoWind-ACCELERATE)</h3>
            <p class="prj_desc">Offshore windfarms will be developed at an accelerated schedule under fast-track plans to switch away from fossil fuels. With ever larger offshore windfarms, and the cumulative effects of climate change, we thus urgently need to understand the way the seabed is modified in response and how such changes affect the wider marine ecosystem. When natural currents in the sea deviate around the wind turbines or anchors, the forces acting on the bed enhance, making sediments move and stay in suspension. This reduces the clarity of the water and changes the shape and sediment composition of the seabed, with impacts stretching far beyond the object. The seabed supports ecosystems that deliver a wide range of services incl. fishing, carbon storage, aggregates and coastal protection. The climate crisis will stretch impacts even further and into coastal zones, as future storm waves and rising sea levels will alter the ways energy from the sea is transferred to the seabed. All these changes combined can have wide-reaching impacts for organisms that live on or in the seabed, potentially changing biodiversity (species richness) and the delivery of some of these ecosystem services. The impacts at the seabed extend through the food chain to the water column and beyond as seabed dwelling fish are consumed by seabirds and cetaceans. Aggregations of fish can be strongly associated to particular seabed properties. If displacement or mortality occurs amongst these important prey species, this has knock-on effects for the deep-diving predators that cannot afford to be less efficient in foraging for food, like the seabirds that are protected by legislation. During this pivotal time of energy transition and national security, it is of crucial importance to better understand and unlock the potential of the marine environment for a renewable energy transition with added benefits to the ecosystem. This project sets out a strategy to assess the seabed response to the combination of accelerated windfarm expansion and accelerated climate change, and to quantify the implications for (1) biodiversity, (2) ecosystem services, (3) habitats, and (4) interactions between seabird populations and their food.</p>

            <p class="prj_desc">A major tidal energy project offshore Anglesey in Wales will benefit from €37.6 million of funding in what is likely to be the last large grant from the EU’s regional funding program for the scheme.The Morlais infrastructure development aims to further advance the development of tidal power generation technologies by providing grid connectivity. <br /> The Crown Estate will invest additional €1.45 million in the Morlais project to support the delivery of its environmental monitoring and mitigation package (EMMP)  an essential step in safeguarding the marine environment and enabling the project to progress, the Welsh Government informed. The work will monitor for interactions with sensitive species, as well as testing ongoing monitoring technologies. It will be applicable to any tidal stream device deployed at the site and represents an important step in addressing significant evidence gaps and consenting challenges faced by the currently data poor tidal sector[<a href="https://www.offshore-energy.biz/morlais-tidal-energy-project-secures-over-e37-million-of-eu-funds//"> offsure energy</a>].<br /> Huge datasets will be generated in the Morlais surveys and an effective monitoring programme cannot be achieved without a data management system. So to fully realise the benefits of this data and implement the EMMP requires a state-of-the-art data management system. We use industry-facing data management system iMarDIS as a secure, cost-effective, cloud-storage solution  industry-facing data management system for data storage. It also provides a platform for data driven innovation drawing on best in class data visualisations and next generation analytics based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.</p>

            <p class="prj_desc">Contrary to popular opinion, only a tiny proportion of land in the UK is actually suitable for the development of wind turbines. Therefore developers seeking to find wind sites undertake what’s called a “sieve analysis”. The sieve analysis includes mapping all the various physical, environmental, technical and policy constraints that would make a site undevelopable for a wind turbine. This then leaves a patchwork of areas that might be suitable. These candidate sites are then considered in further depth[<a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/downloads/reports-and-publications/community-energy/planning/neighbourhood-planning-wind-guidance.pdf"> How to identify suitable areas for onshore wind development in your neighbourhood plan</a>].<br /> In excess of 30 elements can be taken into consideration during planning of renewable energy projects. By quantifying these elements, the percentage of risk is estimated. In this project, the goal is to create a map-based website that can visualise the elements affecting risk. Also we intend to achieve a unified factor for risk assessment based on their combination.</p>

                Considering elements affecting the constraints, in many cases it is more sensible to determine the amount of risk in the form of a linguistic variable (e.g. "very low'' , "very high")  than to express it in the form of a numerical variable. Then, by using an inference engine based on fuzzy logic, the result of different combinations of these variables can be evaluated.

            <p class="prj_desc">Tidal turbines are designed to extract energy from strong tidal currents. However, they have the potential to injure large marine animals. It is thus paramount to monitor the movement and behaviour of these animals near operating turbines, which is traditionally done via passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). PAM consists of recording and analysing the vocalisations from marine mammals, like echolocation clicks and calls. This project aims to develop a tool that automatically classifies marine mammal click detection into species.</p>

                A hierarchical recurrent neural network (HRNN) is used towards the classification of echolocation clicks in three groups of species (Bottlenose or Common dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, Harbour porpoise) or as noise. The HRNN classifier was used to process PAM data collected in a tidal site targeted for the development of renewable energy sources. Classified clicks inform the presence of each species per unit of time.

            <p class="prj_desc">One of the goals of reliability is to identify and manage the risks around assets that could fail and cause unnecessary and expensive downtime. Organizations know it is important to identify areas of potential failures and rate them in terms of likelihood and consequence. ENEL distribution must manage a very complex reality, several control centers (STUX and STM Systems), more than 2200 primary substations (HV/MV) and more than 100000 remote controlled secondary substations (MV/LV) In substation automation systems, SCADA performs the operations like bus voltage control, bus load balancing, circulating current control, overload control, transformer fault protection, bus fault protection, etc. The main idea investigated in this project was to apply predictive maintenance to the medium voltage lines using only SCADA events messages (each of which is coded as a unique string), in order to predict component failures in the distribution grid.</p>

                In this project, a large set of methods was utilized in order to identify patterns and signals in the data to classify anomalies within the SCADA events that lead to faults in the medium voltage lines. Firstly, the work focused on analysing the data in order to understand how to frame the problem. Secondly, both 2supervised and unsupervised techniques were performed to learn patterns and identify which sequences of events are anomalies. The problem was formulated as both a sentiment analysis(supervised) and anomaly detection(unsupervised) problem in NLP. This assumption comes from the fact that with respect to the horizon and sliding window, the sequence of SCADA events that either leads to the fault or not, can be considered as a sequence of words in a sentence. After some embedding methods, the CNN for text classification, RNN based structure (RNN, LSTM, GRU), customized waveNet, VAE and GAN were utilized to predict a sequence of events that leads to the fault. Moreover, in order to extract such SCADA events which are important to the failure and aggregate the representation of those informative SCADA events, attention mechanisms were used.

In this project, we applied a drevitive-free population-based algorithm to train antecedent parameters of fuzzy system structures. These modifications were inspired by natural evolutions.
